# Simplified Casino App

## Overview
This project is a simplified version of the Novibet casino app, designed primarily as a platform to integrate and test an AI model for detecting unsafe gambling behavior. The app allows users to engage in a limited selection of gambling games using fake money while monitoring their gambling habits.

## Features
- **Fake Money System**: Users can add and manage their virtual currency without real-world transactions.
- **Essential Gambling Games**: Includes key casino games such as:
  - Slots
  - Roulette
- **Additional Non-Functional Games**: Extra games may be included to enhance the look and feel of a full-fledged casino experience.
- **AI-Based Gambling Behavior Analysis**:
  - Monitors user behavior to detect potential signs of problem gambling.
  - Assigns a risk score to users based on their gambling patterns.
  - Issues warnings and cooldowns when risky behavior is detected.
  - Notifies responsible gaming teams if necessary.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this app is to integrate and test our AI model, ensuring it accurately identifies and mitigates unsafe gambling behavior. The app itself is not meant for real-money gambling and is strictly for research and development purposes.

## Future Enhancements
- More detailed risk scoring mechanisms.
- Advanced AI-based interventions for safer gambling practices.
- Expanded selection of games and user engagement features.
